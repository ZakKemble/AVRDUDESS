Windows:
--------
Requires .NET Framework 2.0 SP1 or newer. All systems since Windows Vista will have the required version already installed.

Linux & macOS:
--------------
Can be ran using Mono ([http://www.mono-project.com](http://www.mono-project.com)).\
Has not been tested on macOS, but should work. Might need the `--arch=32` argument.

    mono --arch=32 avrdudess.exe

Installing on Ubuntu 18.04 and newer:
-------------------------------------
Install Mono (this is the minimum required, you can use `mono-complete` for a full install):

    sudo apt-get install libmono-system-windows-forms4.0-cil

On older versions of Ubuntu you might need to use `libmono-winforms2.0-cil` instead.

Install AVRDUDE and AVR Binutils (for avr-size):

    sudo apt-get install avrdude binutils-avr

Run AVRDUDESS with mono, you might have to run as root (sudo) so that AVRDUDE can access ports if you haven't changed any permissions or rules.d stuff:

    mono avrdudess.exe

Building:
---------
You will need Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 or newer installed (older might work too). Open `./src/avrdudess.sln` and click the 'Start' button at the top and it will build and run AVRDUDESS.\
You can find the output in `./src/avrdudess/bin/Debug/`, or `./src/avrdudess/bin/Release/` if you chose to build for Release (the drop down box second from the left of the Start button is where you can choose the configuration).

Making the Installer:
---------------------
You will need [Inno Setup](https://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) installed. Once you've used Visual Studio to build the Release version of AVRDUDESS, run `./installer/installer.bat` and the installer exe will appear in the same directory.
